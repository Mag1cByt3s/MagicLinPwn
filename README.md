# MagicLinPwn
MagicLinPwn is a powerful and automated Linux privilege escalation script designed to help security professionals and CTF enthusiasts identify potential misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and weaknesses that can lead to privilege escalation.

Once the script finishes, a comprehensive summary is displayed, providing an overview of the findings and highlighting potential risks.

## Features

- **OS Information Gathering**:
  - Detects and displays the operating system, kernel version, architecture, and hostname.
- **Kernel Exploit Suggestion**:
  - Integrates Linux Exploit Suggester to identify potential kernel         vulnerabilities for privilege escalation.
  - Cross-references the system's kernel version against known exploits.
  - Highlights kernel vulnerabilities that may be exploitable for privilege escalation.
  - Provides direct links to resources for further analysis and exploitation.
  - Displays results in the summary section, flagging any discovered kernel-level privilege escalation vectors.
- **User and Group Information**:
  - Displays the current user, UID, GID, primary group, and group memberships with line wrapping.
  - Highlights critical groups that may allow privilege escalation (e.g., `wheel`, `sudo`, `docker`, `lxd`, `shadow`, etc.).
  - Provides explanations for highlighted groups, including how they can be abused for privilege escalation.
  - Where applicable, includes direct links to **HackTricks** for detailed exploitation techniques.
  - Displays last login information for users who have logged in (using `lastlog` if available), filtering out never-logged-in users.
  - Displays currently logged in users with session details (using `w` if available).
  - Reports if `lastlog` or `w` commands are unavailable.
- **Root Privilege Check**:
  - Detects if the script is running with root privileges (via `UID` or `EUID`).
    - If running as root, suggests using additional tools for credential dumping:
      - [mimipenguin](https://github.com/huntergregal/mimipenguin)
      - [LaZagne.py](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne)
- **Active Directory Integration Check**:
  - Detects if the Linux machine is joined to an Active Directory domain.
  - Displays relevant domain information if detected.
  - If running as root and AD integration is found, suggests using [Linikatz](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/LinikatzV2) for dumping secrets.
- **Docker Container Detection**:
  - Detects if the script is running inside a Docker container by checking:
      - `/proc/1/cgroup`
      - The existence of the `/.dockerenv` file
      - Environment variables (e.g., `DOCKER_CONTAINER`)
  - Suggests running `deepce` for container breakout checks if a container is detected.
